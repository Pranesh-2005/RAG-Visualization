# RAG-Visualization 📊

**RAG-Visualization** is an interactive tool for visualizing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) workflows. It leverages advanced NLP models and interactive visualizations to help you understand and analyze vector embeddings, document retrieval, and clustering processes.

---

## 🚀 Introduction

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) combines information retrieval and generation for powerful NLP workflows. **RAG-Visualization** makes it easy to explore document embeddings, clustering, and retrieval mechanisms using an intuitive Gradio-based interface with dynamic visualizations powered by Plotly.

---

## ✨ Features

- **Interactive Visualizations:** Explore high-dimensional embeddings in 2D or 3D using PCA and Plotly.
- **PDF Document Support:** Upload and process PDF files for embedding and analysis.
- **State-of-the-Art Embeddings:** Utilizes [Sentence Transformers](https://www.sbert.net/) for high-quality sentence and document embeddings.
- **Clustering & Retrieval:** Integrates with FAISS for fast similarity search and clustering.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Simple web interface built with Gradio for accessible experimentation.
